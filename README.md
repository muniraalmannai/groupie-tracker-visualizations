â”œâ”€â”€ handlers.go          # Contains the main HTTP handlers for routing
â”œâ”€â”€ types.go             # Defines data structures used across the application
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css           # Main CSS file for styling and responsive design
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html           # Main page listing all artists
â”œâ”€â”€ artist_details.html  # Detailed view template for individual artists
â”œâ”€â”€ error.html           # Error page template
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod               # Module dependencies and package management
â”œâ”€â”€ static/              # Contains static assets like images
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ graph.png    # Image file for request flow graph
```

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Go (Golang) - Only Go is allowed for this project
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid Layout)
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with theming and responsive design
- **Templating:** Go's `html/template` for server-side rendering

### Request Flow Diagram

Below is a visual representation of the route flow for a user request in the Groupie Tracker application:

![Request Flow Diagram](static/images/graph.png)

### Explanation

1. **User Request**: The user makes a request (e.g., clicks an artist card).
2. **Go Backend**: The request is received and processed by the backend.
3. **`client.go (API Fetch)`**: The backend fetches data from an external API.
4. **API**: The data is retrieved and sent back to `client.go`.
5. **`handlers.go (Data Processing)`**: Processes the data, utilizing data structures defined in **`types.go`**.
6. **Template Rendering**: The processed data is rendered into an HTML template (`index.html`, `artist_details.html`, or `error.html`).
7. **Browser (Display)**: The rendered HTML is sent back to the userâ€™s browser for display.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd groupie-tracker
   ```

2. Install Go dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Run the application locally:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

4. Open the browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to access the application.

### Usage

- Navigate the main page to see a list of artists.
- Click on an artist card for more detailed information.
- Use the back button or navigation links to return to the main page.

### Example Input

The application retrieves data dynamically, but the structure of the artist data includes:
- **Name:** Artist or band name
- **Creation Date:** Year the artist or band was formed
- **First Album:** Name and release date of the first album
- **Members:** List of band members
- **Concert Dates:** Locations and dates of upcoming concerts

### Example Output

The application displays a list of artists, and on selecting an artist, the detailed profile includes:
- **Image:** Artist or band photo
- **Information:** Creation date, first album, and members
- **Concert Schedule:** List of upcoming tour locations and dates

## Development Notes

This project was developed with a focus on clean code and modular design. The Go backend handles routing and data rendering, while the frontend utilizes modern CSS techniques for a polished user experience. Custom Go types and functions ensure a robust and scalable codebase.

### Known Issues

- **Search Functionality:** Future improvements may include implementing a search feature for easier navigation.
- **Data Source:** Currently, the data is static but could be integrated with an API for real-time updates.
